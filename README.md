### InfoQ Java Queue

#### published February 28, 2018

This example application demonstrates the new local-variable type inference and is adapted from [Adrian Finlay's](https://medium.com/@afinlay) [source code repository](https://pastebin.com/qNEUYsBd) based on his [blog post](https://medium.com/@afinlay/java-10-sneak-peek-local-variable-type-inference-var-3022016e1a2b) on Java 10.  

The application can be built and run with [Gradle 4.5.1](https://gradle.org/) by executing the command:

`gradle clean build run`
